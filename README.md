# API-Github-getting-users
The first part of a project called, Separation of developers based on their characteristics which i created a code to get user's characteristics from Github using API.

The dataset we created if comprised of the following
characteristics:

1) Public Repositories: The number of public repositories
the user has created and uploaded. Note that we include
repositories that were forked from other users because they still
indicate a sign of Github activity and we noticed that there
were not users that had a massive number of “forked from”
repos over theirs.

2) Followers: The number of followers of the user also
indicates to a certain extent the importance of the respective
account.

3) Following: The number of users each user follows is
another factor that indicates his Github activity as it shows
interest in other developers’ work.

4) Most Common Language: The most used programming
language of each user should also be taken into account as it
shows the degree in which the user keeps up with the current
trend.

5) Total Stars: Naturally, the number of stars the user’s
repositories have accumulated is an indicator of the importance
of his practices and show his contribution to other developers’
work.

6) Total Forks: The number of repositories the user has
forked from other users is a factor of how much he is involved
with other peoples’ work.

7) Number of Commits: The number of commits of a user is
one the biggest indicators of the user’s activity as it shows his
frequency of his updates of open projects.

8) Watchers/repo: An important characteristic of a user is
the number of watchers (subscribers) a user has per repository
We decided to divide the watchers by the number of his repos
because if it’s different if one has a thousand repos with 1
watcher and another one has one repo with a thousand
watchers. The latter one shows that the work was of high
significance.

9) Percentage of Licenses: This characteristic shows the
percentage of the repositories of user that have a license as it
sometimes can also show the importance of the user’s
repositories as it a license indicates the permissions other users
have on the repo.

10) Open Issues: Another characteristic that shows the
nature of a user’s repositories are the total open issues of his
repositories as it correlates with high Github activity.

11) Closed Issues: The closed issues of a user’s repositories
show his ability to close issues other users have created
